                    <li class="hobby"><strong>Game Design:</strong> Game design was what I went to school for, and I still keep up with it as time allows, mostly working on paper-prototypes and table top designs.</li>
                    <li class="hobby"><strong>Ice Skating:</strong> I have found ice skating to be an enjoyable pastime. There is a rink nearby, 13 bucks gets you skate rental and 2 hour free skate period, check it out.</li>
                    <li class="hobby"><strong>Archery:</strong> I have fallen off this in recent years, lacking easy access, but I find it a zen like experience to target shoot.</li>
